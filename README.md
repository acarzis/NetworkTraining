I wrote this as a training exercise in c++ client-server processing.
The code simulates a server where multiple clients are connecting to it and sending it operations/commands.

The code is a simple example I created rather quickly. I do not believe this is 'real-world' worthy and is not intended for this purpose.

The code should perhaps be expanded to allow 2-way communication, if this makes sense. 
I.E. The server is sending operations to the client.
